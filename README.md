Object Detection with YOLOv5 and Streamlit allows users to upload an image and detect objects using a pre-trained YOLOv5 model. To set up, clone the repository, and download yolov5s.pt from yolov5 releases, placing it in the yolov5 directory. Run the Streamlit application with streamlit run app.py, upload an image (supported formats: jpg, png, jpeg), click "Analyse Image" to detect objects, and view detected object classes listed below the image.
